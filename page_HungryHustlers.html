<p class="intro">

  During the fall of 2022, I worked on Hungry Hustlers, a survival game in which the player plays 
  as an office employee who needs to keep his energy up while conpleting his tasks by sucking up the food 
  around him. </p>

	The theme of this game jam was "I see you" and my team spent a lot of time brainstormin for this game.
	We eventually settled on making an investigative game and our programmer was really interested
	in exploring the topic of how invasive going through peoples web history could be. So, we made it our 
	goal to make the player feel bad and guilty for going through the characters' searches.</p>
	<br>
<p class="para">
	Our main block was the layout of the game. Our inspiration was the indie game Fingered, 
	by James Id and Edmund McMillen, but we had trouble comming up with an original concept without
	accidentally copying the game. I sketched a couple of concepts during that time. Eventually, we 
	decided to have a Windows 95 aesthetic for our game and we wanted the screen to look like a very 
	busy monitor with a lot of tabs open. So, I made a single tab that the programmer could adjust and multiply
	on unity. From then on, my job was to design characters, come up with silly crimes, and write personalized
	web searches for each character.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="para">
	Designing the characters was a pretty simple process for me. A couple were characters I have already made
	and I ask my team if they wanted to be included as suspects (you can find two of us). For the rest, I made some
	different sets of features and would mix and match them for each character. For writting the crime reports,
	I looked up "florida man crimes" and used those as inspiration for the crimes I wrote in the game. My most
	challenging task was to make personalized websearches for each person. I had to come up with backstories 
	for every character that would, not only incriminate or clear them, but also reveal personal aspects of their
	lives that they wouldn't want others to know. </p>
	<br>
  <p class="para">
    I made this game for a Game Jam in a Game Design class along side
    Ã‰tienne Racine the who designed the layout and worked on 
	the programing and Sol Paul who handled the sound.
