<p class="intro">

  During the fall of 2022, I worked on Hungry Hustlers, a survival game in which the player plays 
  as an office employee who needs to keep his energy up while conpleting his tasks by sucking up the food 
  around him. </p>

	This was my very first game jam and I was not
	to sure what to expect. The theme was Hunger and our limitation was that 
	we could only use one button to play. Our main idea was to have something 
	move around randomly as it tries to eat the things around it. We brainstormed
	a couple of settings and settled on an office space. People are often overworked
	to the point of only living off of snacks and we thought this was a fun and relatable
	concept to work with.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="para">
	For the character design, I looked at old flashgames that I played as a kid, to see how they made 
	objects recognisable but simply made. I learned that you can never go wrong with 
	basic shapes, so I stacked a square on a parralelogram and added lines and color to
	indicate what were the legs, arms, eyes and hair. I designed the player first and then
	duplicated him to make the rest of the characters. At some point, I had a bit of a dilemma.
	I noticed that two of the characters were too dark to be seen, I wanted to include characters
	with dark skin, but not being able to see their faces clearly would be a poor design choice. 
	In the end, I decided to keep them as they were since it is common for people with dark skin
	to not show on photos. But I still wonder if my color choice was too dark or if there was something 
	else I could have changed, like making the eyes a lighter color.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="para">
	For the design of the office, i decided to set it up similarly to that of The Office
	since I happenned to be re-watching the show. Surprisingly, I had a hard time deciding 
	on the colors for the room and the furniture. My work is usually very colorful, so I was 
	frustrated at the lack of color there was in the photos of offices I looked up, but I stuck 
	to my moodboard and created assets that I enjoyed looking at.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p class="para">
	Since this was my first project, I had a lot of set backs. One was, that I wasn't able to use github, 
	meaning that I could not put my files on Unity and verify if they looked well. So if I forgot to export
	my files as PNGs or would forget to crop them correcty, I could only fixed them after my teammates noticed,
	but I eventually got better I checking my stuff before sending. Also,I learned that, anytime I transformed a 
	layer on GIMP, the quality would lower, but luckily, since the assets were so small, it wasn't noticeable. </p>
	<br>

   <p class="para">
    I made this game for a Game Jam in a Game Design class with
    Margaret (Meg) Summers who did the programming and Che Tan who
	made the sfx, music and helped with the programming.
