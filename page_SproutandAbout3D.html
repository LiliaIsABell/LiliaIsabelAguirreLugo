<h> Sprout and About </h>

<p class="intro">

  In the winter of 2022, I worked on a game titled Sprout and About, a gardening simulation
  in which the goal is to fill the garden with each type of plant. The player does so, by
  waiting for plants to wilt and then harvest them to receive mulch, allowing the player
  to grow more plants.
</p>

<p class="intro">
  I made this game for a Game Jam in a Game Design class along side
  Owen Hellum and Joseph Boumerhi who handled the programing, sounds and additional 2D art.

<!-- Description -->

<p class="intro"> I thought I was going to have an easier time with this project because I have previously created plant models
  (See Market) and I wanted to reuse them so that I could focus on other tasks such as making the intro scene, garden fence and
  background elements. However, my models were unfortunately too large for the game, so I had to remake new low poly versions
  of the plants. I found it challenging to make low poly plants that still resembled real plants, but I succeeded and, in the end,
  those plant models were easier for me transform them into wilted and dead versions of each. </p>
  <p class="intro"> Surprisingly, creating the fence was the easiest task. For the design, I looked at some Mexican and Japanese style gardens to
  see in what kind of enclosure they have them in and then I just needed to model a door, a single part of the fence and a coner piece and used
  some nodes to make an even square shape. </p>
  <p class="intro"> We only had 3 weeks to complete this game and although I would have liked to make the background look like a forest with
  nicer models, those were my last priority and made something simple. However, some playtesters believe it fit the childlike style of the game
  so the style ended up working out in our favor.</p>
