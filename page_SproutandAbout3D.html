<h> Sprout and About </h>

<p class="intro">
  In the winter of 2022, I worked on a game titled Sprout and About, a gardening simulation
  in which the goal is to fill the garden with all four types of plant. The player does so by
  waiting for plants to wilt, harvest them to receive mulch, and then using it grow more plants.

<!-- Description -->

<div id="dropdown6">

<p class="para"> I thought I was going to have an easier time with this project because I had previously created plant models
  (See Market) and I wanted to reuse them so that I could focus on other tasks such as making the intro scene, garden fence and
  background elements. However, my models were unfortunately too large for the game, so I had to remake new low poly versions
  of the plants. I found it challenging to make low poly plants that still resembled real plants, but I succeeded and, in the end,
  those plant models were easier for me transform them into wilted and dead versions of each. </p>
  <br><br>
  <p class="para"> Surprisingly, creating the fence was the easiest task. For the design, I looked at some Mexican and Japanese style gardens to
  see in what kind of enclosure they have them in for reference, and then I modelled a door, a single part of the fence and a coner piece. I then used
  some geometry nodes in blender to make an even square shape. </p>
  <br><br>
  <p class="para">I would have liked to make the background look like a forest with nicer models than it currently has, but
  since we only had three weeks to make the game,those were my last priority. However, some playtesters believe it fit the childlike style of the game,
  so it ended up working out in our favor.</p>
  <br><br>
  <p class="para">
  I made this game for a Game Jam in a Game Design class along side
  Owen Hellum who handled the programing and additional 2D art and 
  Joseph Boumerhi who made the sounds and music.</p>
