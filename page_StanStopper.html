<h> Stan Stopper </h>

<p class="intro">

  During the winter of 2022, I made the art for the game Stan Stopper. It is an
  arcade style game in which you play as a bodyguard who needs to protect the kpop
  idol from having fangirls disrupt his performance. With the help of a t-shirt
  cannon, the player must shoot the fans before they reach the idol and push
  them off the stage.</p>

  Out of all the game jams I made for that course, this one challenged me the most because it was my first time making pixel art
  and sprite sheets for a game. I remember I first made gifs for the running animation until one of my teamates told me about sprite sheets.
  I learned how to make them really quickly, but I had a hard time making pixel art and had to improvise. On GIMP, I drew the character
  how I normally would, added a grid over it and filled in the squares to give it the pixelated look. A few months later, I took a workshop
  on pixel art and learned that the technique I used was completely wrong and that pixel art requieres a lot more focus and care than I thought. </p>

  <p class="para">
  I made this game for a Game Jam in a Game Design class with
  Ã‰tienne Racine who handled the programming and Che Tan who made
  the sfx and music, as well as helped with the art and programming.

<h1  onclick="bodyguard()" >  Bodyguard </h1>
</div>
<div> <img class="Bodyguard" src="assets/art/StanStopper/Idle.png" alt="Bodyguard Default Apperance"  >
 <p class="text"> The bodyguard is who the player plays as. I came up with the design for this character pretty quickly. Because
 the game is themed around kpop, I looked up photos of specifically Korean bodyguards to see if they dressed differently to American ones.
 Interestingly, there was no significant difference but I noticed that the bodyguards were either bald or kept their hair short,
 so I made sure to give this charcter a short and well coiffed hairstyle. </p>

<h1 onclick="fangirl()"> Fangirl </h1>
</div>
<div> <img class="Fangirl" src="assets/art/StanStopper/Fangirl.png" alt="Fangirl Default Apperance"  >
<p class="text"> The fangirls are the enemies of the game. I was most excited to design this character because, I myself am a kpop fan,
and this was my opportunity to include the diversity that exist in the fandom. However, due to a lack of time, I only
created one design and ask a teammate to make variations of it. I decided to have my original design be a Korean teen, so
I looked up hair and fashion trends in Korea, which allowed me to have lots of fun creating her. Fun Fact: I wanted each
variation of the fangirl to be of different races, however, my team was concerned that if they were to assign an ability
to a specific race, we may accidentally perpetuate harmful stereotypes. My solution to this was to be very critical of each
ability, and if there was one that seemed slightly problematic, then we would come up with a new ability. </p>

</div>
<div> <img class="Idol" src="assets/art/StanStopper/Idol.png" alt="Fangirl Default Apperance"  >
  <p class="text"> The idol is the character the player needs to protect from the fangirls. This was the chracter I had the most difficulty
  designing because I originally based his apperance after the kpop idols I grew up with, such as SHINee and Super Junior,
  who often wore colorful suits, but I decided that my design should reflect idols who are currently popular. So, I used BTS
  and TXT as references and noticed that they wore more casual and minimalistic clothes and adjusted my design. </p>

    <img class="Shirt" src="assets/art/StanStopper/T-Shirt.png" alt="Shirt"  >
    <p class="text"> The T-shirt gun is the player's weapon that pushes the fangirls off the stage.
    We decided this as our weapon because we thought it would be odd if the bodyguard were to shoot
    girls with bullets. The T-shirt gun was a fun replacement and it fit the context of a concert </p>

    <p class="text"> To design the crowd, I look at photos of kpop concerts for inspiration. I noticed that
		the attendants often hold light sticks, so I decided to make the crowd hold them and have them move back
		and forth as if they were waving their light sticks.</p>
