<h> Stan Stopper </h>

<p class="intro">

  During the winter of 2022, I made the art for the game Stan Stopper. It is an
  arcade style game in which you play as a bodyguard who needs to protect the kpop
  idol from having fangirls disrupt his performance. With the help of a t-shirt
  cannon, the player must shoot the fans before they reach the idol and push
  them off the stage.</p>

<p class="intro">
  I made this game for a Game Jam in a Game Design class along side
  Ã‰tienne Racine and Che Tan who handled the programing, sounds and additional art.

<p class="intro">

  Out of all the game jams I made for that course, this one challenged me the most because it was my first time making pixel art
  and sprite sheets for a game. I remember I first made gifs for the running animation until one of my teamates told me about sprite sheets.
  I learned how to make sprite sheets really quickly, but I had a hard time making pixel art and had to improvise. On GIMP, I drew the character
  how I normally would, added a grid over it and filled in the squares to give it the pixelated look. A few months later, I took a workshop
  on pixel art, out of curiosity, and learned that the technique I used was completely wrong and that pixel art requieres a lot more
  more focus and care than I thought. </p>

<div class="description"> <img class="Bodyguard" src="assets/art/StanStopper/Idle.png" alt="Bodyguard Default Apperance"  >
 <p class="text"> The bodyguard is who the player plays as. I came up for a design for this character pretty quickly. However, because
 the game is themed around kpop, I looked up photos of specifically Korean bodyguards to see if they dressed a differently to American ones.
 Interestingly, there was no significant difference but I noticed that the bodyguards were either bald or kept their hair short,
 so I made sure to give this charcter a short and well coiffed hairstyle. </p>

<div class="description"> <img class="Fangirl" src="assets/art/StanStopper/Fangirl.png" alt="Fangirl Default Apperance"  >
<p class="text"> The fangirls are the enemies of the game. I was the most excited to design this character because I myself am a fan of kpop
and this was my opportunity to include the diversity that exist in the kpop fandom. However, do to a lack of time, I only
created one design and ask a teammate to make variations of it. I decided to have my original design be a Korean teen, so
I looked up hair and fashion trends in Korea, which allowed me to have lots of fun creating her. Fun Fact: I wanted each
variation of the fangirl to be of different races, however, my team was concerned that if they were to assign an ability
to a specific race, we may be accidentally perpetuating harmful stereotypes. My solution to it, was to be very critical of each
ability, and if there is one that seems even slightly problematic, then we should come up with a new ability. </p>

<div class="description"> <img class="Idol" src="assets/art/StanStopper/Idol.png" alt="Fangirl Default Apperance"  >
  <p class="text"> The idol is the character the player needs to protect from the fangirls. This was the chracter I had the most difficuty
  designing, because I originally based his apperance after the kpop idols I grew up with such as SHINee and Super Junior
  who often wore colorful suits, but I realised that my design should reflect idols who are currently popular. So, I used BTS
  and TXT as references and noticed that they wore more casual and minimalistic clothes and adjusted my design. </p>

    <img class="Shirt" src="assets/art/StanStopper/T-Shirt.png" alt="Shirt"  >
    <p class="text"> The T-shirt gun is the player's weapon that pushes the fangirls off the stage.
    We decided this as our weapon because we thought it would be odd if the bodyguard were to shoot
    girls with bullets. The T-shirt gun was a more fun replacement and it fit the context of a concert </p>
