<h> Sprout and About </h>

<p class="intro">

  In the winter of 2022, I worked on a game titled Sprout and About, a gardening simulation
  in which the goal is to fill the garden with each type of plant. The player does so, by
  waiting for plants to wilt and then harvest them to receive mulch, allowing the player
  to grow more plants.
</p>

<p class="intro">
  I made this game for a Game Jam in a Game Design class along side
  Owen Hellum and Joseph Boumerhi who handled the programing, sounds and additional 2D art.
 </p>

 <p class="intro">

   This game was tricky to make because our professor challenged us to make a game without
   any text, meaning that we had to find creative ways to instruct people how to play. One
   of our solutions was to make a cutscene to introduce the context and goal of the game, and
   it was my job to make it.
 </p>

</video>

<p class="intro">

  We only had 3 weeks to work on the entire game, so I decided to make the cutscene
  an animatic to save time. I made a storyboard that I would share with classmates and
  friends to receive feedback to make sure that the story and goal of the game is clearly
  presented. I then made a new storyboard that I had both the previous people and
  new people review. Finally, I made each frame on GIMP and then made the video composition on
  Adobe Premiere Pro.
