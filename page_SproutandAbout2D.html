<p class="intro">

  In the winter of 2022, I worked on a game titled Sprout and About, a gardening simulation
  in which the goal is to fill the garden with all four types of plant. The player does so by
  waiting for plants to wilt, harvest them to receive mulch, and then using it grow more plants.

 <p class="para">
   This game was tricky to make because our professor challenged us to make a game without
   any text, meaning that we had to find creative ways to instruct people how to play. One
   of our solutions was to make a video to introduce the context and goal of the game, and
   it was my job to make it.</p>
 <br><br>
 <p class="para">
  We only had 3 weeks to work on the entire game, so I decided to make the intro scene
  an animatic to save time. I made a storyboard that I would share with classmates and
  friends to receive feedback to make sure that the story and goal of the game was clearly
  presented. I then made a new storyboard that I had both the previous people and
  new people review. Finally, I made each frame on GIMP and then made the video composition on
  Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
 <br><br>
 <p class="para">
  I made this game for a Game Jam in a Game Design class along side
  Owen Hellum who handled the programing and additional 2D art and
  Joseph Boumerhi who made the sounds and music.</p>
