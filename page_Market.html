<p class="intro">

  This project is a remake of a school assignment in which I had to redesign
  an existing subterranean public space in the Montreal downtown RESO system.
  The purpose of this assignment was to practice making realistic models and textures,
  so I made it my goal to model every element of the environment myself.

    Originally, the professor asked us to redesign the space however we wanted
    whether it would be fantastic or realistic, as long as our models and textures
    look realistic. Since we were free to do anything, I wanted to make an underground
    market. Something reminiscent of the spirit town from the movie Spirited Away.
    However, the teacher later requiered us to make something that could exist in a near
    future. So, during the summer break, I decided to create my original concept, without
    the creative and time restrictions.</p>
    <br><br>
  <p class="para">
    For the original project, we worked in teams of two.  We started by going out to find a location we liked and
    took measurements so that our model have the real life dimensions. Using those measurements,
    I made the base of the environment and my teammate then built everything else using that base. Luckily,
    I still had that scene saved on my computer, so I used that same base for my own project
    to avoid restarting the whole process. </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="para">
    I began by making a block out of my project, to get and idea
    of how I wanted everything to be placed and how I wanted certain objects to look like. I then
    refined by block out by adding details the objects I had already made and by making new simple objects
    that I knew would be multipling often, such as pots and lanterns. Lastly, before starting to unwrap the UV's, I made
    the more complex objects, such as plants and books. </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="para">
    I would like to take a moment to share the influences that I have had during the creative process. My original idea
    was based of the film Spirited Away. I wanted to have East Asian inspired buildings, food booths and advertisments.
    But as I kept creating, I started to lean more towards a fantasy and magical concept. A market where you can find
    crystals, potions, tarot cards and also food. I still took inspiration from East Asia, but I also took inspiration
    from European style furniture and also Moroccan lanterns. I am aware that it easy to get lost within our
    creative process, so I wanted to mention from which cultures I know for sure I took concepts from. </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="para">
    Unwrapping the UV's was a really long process, especially because it was my first time working with many
    oddly shaped models, such as the plants and flower shaped lamps and lanterns, but I did manage to unwrap them
    well enough for the textures to look good. Besides that, another minor problem I came across was that I would
    have duplicated certain objects, and instead of deleting it, unwrapping one and then duplicating it,
    I would unwrap each object and then realize that my job could have been a lot easier if I had noticed earlier.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="para">
    It then came time to texture. ALthough, I succesfully made all the models myself, I did strugle makung certain
    textures. So I made metal and some marble textures, but for wood, leather and fabrics I used Adobe Substance Painter.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="para">
    I would end it here, but that would not be the true end of my project because I did add some animated elements.
    I included some floating lanterns to add more lighting and for an additional touch of a magic to the environment. I also
    had a camera animation that would give a tour of the market. Unfortunately, after several days of rendering,
    my computer crashed. I had to reboot and lost all my progress. From this experience, I learned that, for animations,
    I should export each frame individualy rather than the whole video, this way, if my computer crashes, I do not lose
    all my progress. Luckily, during my final semester at Concordia University, I learned several ways to make the rendering
    process easier on my computer, such as using my graphics card to render and lowering certain render properties.
    Hopefully it works out the next time I try now knowing this new information.</p>
